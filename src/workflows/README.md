# Workflows

This directory contains predefined workflow sequences and patterns for agent operations in the Coherence Weaver system.

## Purpose

Workflows define complex multi-step processes that can be executed by agents, such as:

- Information gathering and analysis sequences
- Decision-making pipelines
- Multi-agent coordination patterns
- Task decomposition and delegation flows
- Integration with external systems

## Usage

Workflows should be implemented as reusable classes or functions that orchestrate a series of operations, often combining multiple tools, models, and agent capabilities.

Example:
```python
from coherence_weaver.src.workflows import research_workflow

# Initialize and run a workflow
workflow = research_workflow.ResearchWorkflow(topic="AI safety")
results = workflow.execute()
```

## Creating New Workflows

When creating new workflows:

1. Define clear inputs and outputs
2. Document the steps and their purpose
3. Handle errors and edge cases appropriately
4. Consider making workflows composable when possible
5. Include appropriate logging and monitoring
