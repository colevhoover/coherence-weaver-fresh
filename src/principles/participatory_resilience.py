"""
Participatory Resilience Principles for the Coherence Weaver Agent.
Based on the Empire of Participatory Resilience framework.

This module defines a comprehensive set of principles organized into domains (Core, Cultural,
Technical, and Trade/Hybrid) along with meta-principles that enhance and organize other principles.
The module provides utilities for accessing, relating, and applying these principles within
agent operations.
