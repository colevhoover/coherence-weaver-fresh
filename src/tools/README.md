# Tools

This directory contains utility functions and specialized tools that support agent operations in the Coherence Weaver system.

## Purpose

Tools in this directory provide specific capabilities that agents can utilize for different tasks, such as:

- Text processing utilities
- Data transformation functions
- Resource access and management tools
- Integration capabilities with external systems
- Specialized reasoning or computation helpers

## Usage

Tools should be implemented as standalone modules that can be imported and used by agent implementations. They should follow a consistent interface pattern and include proper documentation.

Example:
```python
from coherence_weaver.src.tools import text_analysis

# Use a tool from the module
analysis_result = text_analysis.extract_key_concepts(text_input)
