# Data

This directory stores data files used by the Coherence Weaver system.

## Purpose

The data directory serves as a repository for various types of data, such as:

- Training datasets
- Validation datasets
- Test datasets
- Reference data
- Generated outputs
- Intermediate processing results
- Cached resources

## Organization

Data files should be organized into appropriate subdirectories based on their purpose, type, or the component that uses them. Consider using a structure like:

```
data/
  ├── raw/           # Original, immutable data
  ├── processed/     # Cleaned and processed data
  ├── interim/       # Intermediate data that has been transformed
  ├── external/      # Data from third-party sources
  ├── cache/         # Cached results and temporary data
  └── outputs/       # Generated data and final results
```

## Data Management

- Large data files should not be committed to version control
- Consider using data versioning tools for managing dataset versions
- Document data sources, formats, and schemas
- Include README files in subdirectories to explain their specific contents
