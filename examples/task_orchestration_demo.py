        ## Capability Gaps

        1. **Industry-Specific Knowledge**: None of the agents specifically mention smart home or AI product expertise. This can be mitigated by providing additional context and industry reports during initialization.

        2. **Integration Engineering**: While the analysis covers marketing and business aspects thoroughly, technical integration considerations for smart home ecosystems may need supplemental expertise.

        3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Smart home devices often face privacy and security regulations that may require specialized knowledge not explicitly mentioned in the agent capabilities.

        ## Coordination Recommendations

        1. **Data Analyst ↔ Strategy Agent**: Establish detailed data sharing protocols for market research data to be efficiently utilized in competitive analysis and market sizing.

        2. **Strategy Agent ↔ Customer Insights Agent**: Create joint workspace for sharing findings on market positioning that inform customer segmentation.

        3. **Customer Insights + Strategy → Pricing Strategy**: Scheduled joint meeting to transfer key insights from both customer segmentation and competitive analysis to inform pricing strategy.

        4. **All Agents → Visualization Agent**: Standardized output format to ensure consistent integration into the final report.

        5. **Coherence Weaver**: Oversee all coordination points, with particular attention to the final integration phase.
