# Progress: Coherence Weaver with Participatory Resilience

## What Works

### Core Principle Framework
- ✅ Complete principle dictionary implementation
- ✅ Domain-separated principle organization (Core, Cultural, Technical, Trade)
- ✅ Meta-principles for system evolution
- ✅ Basic utility functions:
  - `get_principle()` - retrieve a specific principle
  - `get_principles_by_domain()` - filter principles by domain
  - `get_related_principles()` - find related principles

### Principle Application
- ✅ Basic principle application mechanism (`apply_principle_to_decision()`)
- ✅ Domain-specific influence functions
- ✅ Weighted principle guidance generation (`create_principle_guidance()`)
- ✅ Meta-principle application framework (`apply_meta_principles()`)

### Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive memory bank documentation
- ✅ Architecture diagrams
- ✅ Implementation patterns
- ✅ Integration specifications

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Implementation (Phase 3 of 5)

### Phase 1: Core Principle Module ✅
Completed implementation of the principle dictionaries, utility functions, and application mechanisms. The participatory_resilience.py module provides a solid foundation for the rest of the integration.

### Phase 2: Memory Bank Documentation ✅
Completed comprehensive documentation of the principle framework, integration architecture, and implementation approach. This provides clear guidance for the remaining implementation work.

### Phase 3: Agent Integration 🔄
Currently in progress. Planning implementation of PrincipleEngine and CoherenceWeaverAgent enhancements to integrate principles into agent operations.

### Phase 4: Protocol Extensions ⏳
Not yet started. Will extend communication protocols to express and exchange principle-related information.

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation ⏳
Not yet started. Will implement comprehensive testing and metrics for evaluating principle application effectiveness.

## Known Issues

### 1. Performance Concerns
- **Issue**: Principle application may introduce performance overhead
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Plan**: Implement caching layer and selective application
- **Status**: Design complete, implementation pending

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- **Issue**: Ensuring principle enhancements don't break existing functionality
- **Severity**: High
- **Plan**: Comprehensive testing with existing agent configurations
- **Status**: Test plan defined, implementation pending

### 3. Principle Conflict Resolution
- **Issue**: Handling conflicts between principles in different domains
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Plan**: Implement principle_harmonization meta-principle
- **Status**: Design complete, implementation pending

### 4. Documentation Clarity
- **Issue**: Making principle application transparent to users
- **Severity**: Low
- **Plan**: Create visualization tools and explanatory mechanisms
- **Status**: Design exploration phase

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Implementation Approach

#### Initial Concept (February 2025)
Originally considered implementing principles as rules with direct effects on decision outcomes.

#### Revised Approach (March 2025) 
Shifted to weighted influence model based on early prototyping that showed rule-based systems were too rigid for complex agent interactions.

#### Current Implementation (May 2025)
Full weighted influence model with domain balance and meta-principle application. This provides both flexibility and predictability in principle application.

### Principle Organization

#### Initial Structure (February 2025)
Flat list of principles with tags.

#### Intermediate Structure (March 2025)
Categorized principles but without formal relationships.

#### Current Structure (May 2025)
Hierarchical organization with:
- Domain-separated principle dictionaries
- Explicit cross-domain principles
- Meta-principles that operate on other principles
- Relationship mechanisms for principle cascading

### Integration Strategy

#### Initial Plan (February 2025)
Parallel implementation alongside existing agent code.

#### Revised Plan (March 2025)
Layered approach with principles as an optional enhancement.

#### Current Approach (May 2025)
Deep integration throughout agent systems with:
- Core principle module
- PrincipleEngine integration
- Protocol extensions
- Trust network enhancement
- While maintaining backward compatibility through optional application

## Success Metrics

We'll measure the success of the participatory resilience integration through:

### 1. Functional Metrics
- Implementation completeness (% of planned features)
- Test coverage (% of code/features tested)
- Performance impact (< 10% overhead target)

### 2. Operational Metrics
- Decision quality improvement (measured through simulations)
- Collaboration effectiveness (successful multi-agent tasks)
- Failure recovery (system resilience to agent failures)

### 3. Adoption Metrics
- Principle-aware agent registrations
- Principle guidance utilization
- Protocol extension adoption
