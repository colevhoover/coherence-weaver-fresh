# System Patterns: Coherence Weaver with Participatory Resilience

## System Architecture

The enhanced Coherence Weaver architecture integrates participatory resilience principles into its foundation, creating a more adaptable, ethical, and distributive system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Core["Core Coherence Weaver"]
        A[Base Agent] --> B[Principles Engine]
        B --> C[Agent Registry]
        B --> D[Task Orchestration]
        B --> E[Trust Network]
    end
    
    subgraph Protocols["Communication Protocols"]
        F[A2A Protocol] 
        G[First Contact Protocol]
        H[Task Assignment Protocol]
    end
    
    subgraph Principles["Participatory Resilience"]
        I[Core Principles]

    end

```

### Key Components

1. **Principles Engine**: The new component that processes and applies participatory resilience principles to agent operations, making them a foundational element rather than an afterthought.

2. **Enhanced Agent Registry**: Now includes principle alignment assessment and support for distributed consensus models.

3. **Principle-Guided Task Orchestration**: Distributes tasks using participatory models that consider agent capabilities, loading, and ethical alignment.

4. **Regenerative Trust Network**: Trust models now incorporate meta-principles like emergent networks and principle reinforcement.

5. **A2A Protocol Extensions**: Enhanced to express principle-based considerations in agent-to-agent communication.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Principle Integration Strategy: Weighted Influence vs. Hard Rules

We've chosen to implement principles as weighted influences rather than hard rules. This allows for:
- Contextual adaptation of principles
- Graceful handling of principle conflicts
- Emergent behavior from principle interactions

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
def apply_principle_to_decision(principle_name, decision_context):
    # Retrieve principle
    principle = get_principle(principle_name)
    
    # Apply weighted influence based on domain and context
    # Rather than enforcing a rule
    updated_context = apply_weighted_influence(decision_context, principle)
    
    return updated_context
```

### 2. Domain Balance: Tripartite Consideration

All significant agent decisions consider implications across cultural, technical, and trade domains, with configurable weights based on the decision type.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
def make_decision(decision_context, domain_weights=None):
    # Default weights if not specified
    domain_weights = domain_weights or {
        "Culture": 0.4, 
        "Tech": 0.4, 
        "Trade": 0.2
    }
    
    # Get relevant principles from each domain
    principles_by_domain = {
        domain: get_principles_by_domain(domain)
        for domain in domain_weights.keys()
    }
    
    # Apply principles with appropriate weighting
    result = weighted_principle_application(
        decision_context, 
        principles_by_domain,
        domain_weights
    )
    
    return result
```

### 3. Meta-Principle Application: Enabling Evolution

The system implements meta-principles that allow the principle framework itself to evolve and adapt over time, creating a living system rather than a static ruleset.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
def apply_meta_principles(principles_set):
    # Start with our current principles
    enhanced_set = principles_set.copy()
    
    # Apply meta-principles to evolve the set
    for meta_name in META_PRINCIPLES:
        if should_apply_meta_principle(meta_name, principles_set):
            enhanced_set = apply_specific_meta_principle(
                meta_name, 
                enhanced_set
            )
    
    return enhanced_set
```

### 4. Distributed Consensus: Shared Power Implementation

For critical decisions that affect multiple agents, a distributed consensus model is used rather than centralized authority.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
async def reach_consensus(decision_context, participating_agents):
    # Collect perspectives from all participating agents
    perspectives = await gather_agent_perspectives(
        decision_context, 
        participating_agents
    )
    
    # Synthesize perspectives using principle-guided methods
    consensus = synthesize_perspectives(
        perspectives,
        principle_guidance=create_principle_guidance(
            "consensus_building"
        )
    )
    
    return consensus
```

## Design Patterns in Use

### 1. Principle Cascading Pattern

Principles are applied in networks that allow them to cascade and reinforce each other, creating emergent effects beyond individual principles.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial Principle] --> B[Related Principle 1]
    A --> C[Related Principle 2]
    B --> D[Secondary Effect 1]
    C --> E[Secondary Effect 2]
    D --> F[Emergent Outcome]
    E --> F
```

### 2. Regenerative Resource Pattern

Resource allocation follows circular patterns that prioritize renewal and equitable distribution.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Resource Source] --> B[Resource Allocation]
    B --> C[Resource Utilization]
    C --> D[Resource Regeneration]
    D --> A
```

### 3. Trust Network Evolution Pattern

Trust relationships evolve based on principle alignment and historical interactions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial Trust] --> B[Principle-Guided Interaction]
    B --> C[Observed Outcomes]
    C --> D[Trust Evaluation]
    D --> E[Updated Trust Model]
    E --> B
```

### 4. Cultural Translation Pattern

Enables agents with different designs, capabilities, and domains to effectively communicate and collaborate.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent A Context] --> B[Cultural Translation]
    C[Agent B Context] --> B
    B --> D[Shared Understanding]
    D --> E[Effective Collaboration]
```

## Component Relationships

### Agent Registry & Principles Engine

The Agent Registry now considers principle alignment when matching agents for tasks, creating more effective collaborations.

### Task Orchestration & Trust Network

Task assignments integrate trust levels that are informed by principle-based evaluations of past performance.

### First Contact Protocol & Principles Engine

The First Contact Protocol now includes exchange of principle alignment information to establish baseline compatibility.
